================

aircraft install :
http://wiki.flightgear.org/Howto:Install_aircraft


How to start ?
==============

1/ first, loose 2 minutes to read
---------------------------------
- HELP.txt : aircraft documentation for pilot
- FEATURES.txt
- Known bugs below

2/ sorry, it's a beta
---------------------

for the best experience I recommend :
- use flightgear version >= 2016.3.1
- to see lights, shadows and reheat, enable ALS (atmospheric light scattering)

3/ launch
---------

launch flightgear from a gui and select the aircraft : panthera

enjoy ;)


Known bugs :(
=============

How to help for developpment ?
==============================

- read HELP.txt
- read LAYOUT.txt
- read FILES.txt
- read TODO.txt
- ask me to get ressources.tar.gz file, it contains blender, xcf, scripts, doc
- improve and discuss on forum
- KEEP IN MIND theese keywords : keep it simply stupid (KISS), lean, maintainability, reusability, correct indentation
- please dont copy/past from other aircrafts, ok it's more fast but day after days, it could creates a technical debt (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt)
- test
- update TODO, CHANGELOG, FEATURES and ... AUTHORS ;)
- post me your changes (merge request on github)
